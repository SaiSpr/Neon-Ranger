# Neon-Ranger
Prototype for a platformer game

Theme : Aliens invaded the earth and stole our energy source "Shakth". Your mission is to land on their spaceship and get back our shakth back.

This HTML5 game is free and available to use for anyone interested in making games in HTML5 or Construct 2. The idea here is to take one of my games, tweek and customize some of the details to then be able to create a game quickly. Why rewrite logic for a game when someone has already done it, right? That's the point. I encourage and challenge you to leverage what I or others have already worked on so that the process will be that much easier you. Why reinvent the wheel?
